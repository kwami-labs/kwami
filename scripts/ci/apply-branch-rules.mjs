/**
 * Apply this repository's rulesets, as code.
 *
 * The pipeline assumes protections that live in GitHub rather than in this repo (see
 * docs/ci-cd.md). Clicking them into the UI means they drift silently and nobody can diff them,
 * so they are declared as data in `.github/rulesets/*.json` — the literal API payloads — and
 * this script applies them idempotently: an existing ruleset with the same name is updated in
 * place rather than duplicated.
 *
 * The declarations are JSON rather than object literals in this file for one reason: a rule is
 * a decision about who can change what, and a decision should be reviewable on its own. A diff
 * of `.github/rulesets/main.json` says "the approval count went from 1 to 0" in one line, and
 * CODEOWNERS already puts `/.github/` behind a review.
 *
 *   main   PR + 1 approval + Code Owner review, `ci gate` and `enforce promotion path` required,
 *          up to date before merging, no force pushes, no deletion, merge commits only.
 *   stg    the same, minus the Code Owner review.
 *   dev    PR required and `ci gate` required, but no approval count and squash merges — this is
 *          where work lands, and blocking it on a reviewer stalls a solo repo.
 *   tags   `v*` cannot be deleted, moved or force-updated by anyone, bot included.
 *
 * `github-actions[bot]` bypasses the pull-request rule on the branches: release.yml pushes the
 * release commit, the tag and the post-release back-merges directly. It does NOT bypass the
 * status checks, and it does NOT bypass the tag rules — nothing in the release flow ever needs
 * to delete or move a tag, and semantic-release's entire notion of "what shipped" is those tags.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   gh auth login                       # needs `repo` / admin on the repository
 *   node scripts/ci/apply-branch-rules.mjs [--dry-run] [--repo owner/name]
