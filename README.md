**Kwami v3** is a Solana NFT collection and fully on-chain web3 app. Connect with [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), fund via [MoonPay](https://www.moonpay.com/), mint a Kwami, publish it, and let others challenge it in a timed voice duel for a share of its account balance.

## Overview

Kwami combines a **Solana NFT**, a **funded on-chain account**, and a **voice AI companion**. Authors mint and publish Kwamis; challengers pay in **SOL** or **USDC** for a **3-minute** voice session to discover the secret word or phrase.

| Outcome                            | Result                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Challenger says the secret in time | Receives **80%** of the Kwami’s account balance (SOL + USDC) |
| Time runs out or secret is wrong   | Ticket is lost; the author’s Kwami account keeps growing     |

Kwamis are **immutable** metadata but **transferable** assets — they can be bought and sold. The 3D model can be embedded in third-party apps. Minted owners unlock an **AI program builder** that generates Solana sub-programs for complex financial games before publish.

---

## Features

- **Solana NFT collection** — mint, own, transfer, and trade Kwamis
- **Phantom wallet** — connect and sign on Solana
- **MoonPay on-ramp** — fiat → SOL/USDC without leaving the app
- **Paid voice challenges** — SOL or USDC tickets, 3-minute sessions
- **Account economics** — 80% reward on win; pot grows on miss
- **Kwami death** — dies after losing **99%** of account value, or when balance falls under **~$1 USD**
- **Immutable + transferable** — metadata locked; ownership can change on secondary markets
- **Embeddable 3D model** — integrate the Kwami avatar in any third-party app
- **AI program builder** — generate Solana sub-programs and smart-contract logic for custom financial games before publishing

| Concept                | Detail                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mint & publish**     | Create a Kwami NFT, fund its account, set a secret, optionally customize Solana logic, then publish |
| **Paid interaction**   | Challengers pay in SOL or USDC for a voice session                                                  |
| **Voice challenge**    | 3-minute window to discover the secret by speaking to the Kwami                                     |
| **Reward split**       | Correct guess → 80% of balance to the challenger; miss → author keeps the ticket                    |
| **Death**              | Loses 99% of account value, or balance under ~$1 USD                                                |
| **Ownership**          | Immutable metadata; transferable NFT (buy / sell)                                                   |
| **3D model**           | Embeddable in third-party applications                                                              |
| **AI program builder** | Generate Solana sub-programs for complex games before publish                                       |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

| Tool                           | Requirement                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | Version in [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) (`>= 22.14`) — `nvm use`                                    |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)       | `>= 10` — `corepack enable` picks up `packageManager` from [`package.json`](./package.json) |

`pnpm-lock.yaml` is the lockfile of record. CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile`; an `npm install` here produces a lockfile CI will reject.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwami-labs/kwami.git
cd kwami
nvm use
corepack enable
pnpm install    # also installs husky hooks
```

### Build & verify

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:run
```

### Consume the package

```bash
pnpm add kwami          # latest stable (main)
pnpm add kwami@rc       # release candidate (stg)
pnpm add kwami@dev      # prerelease (dev)
```

`three` is a peer dependency when embedding the 3D model:

```bash
pnpm add three
```

---

## Scripts

```bash
# Build
pnpm build              # bundle + type declarations → dist/
pnpm dev                # rebuild on change
pnpm clean              # remove dist/, coverage/, and test output

# Quality
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix
pnpm format
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm audit:ci

# Tests — see docs/testing.md
pnpm test               # unit
pnpm test:watch
pnpm test:coverage      # unit + coverage ratchet (CI)
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e           # built bundle in a real browser (WebGL)
pnpm test:all

# Releases — see docs/releases.md
pnpm release:dry-run    # print next version; change nothing
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please read **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** before opening a PR.

**Branch promotion** (enforced in CI):

```text
feature/* ──► dev ──► stg ──► main
```

- Branch off `dev`; open PRs against `dev`
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — versions, tags, changelog, and npm publishes are derived from them
- Feature PRs are **squash-merged**; the PR title becomes the release subject
- Before push: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:unit && pnpm test:integration`

Issue tracker: [github.com/kwami-labs/kwami/issues](https://github.com/kwami-labs/kwami/issues)

## Security

**Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.**

Report privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/kwami-labs/kwami/security/advisories/new). Policy: **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)**. Deploying the library (agent identity, provider keys, tool handlers): **[docs/security.md](./docs/security.md)**.

## Releases

Releases are automated with [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/). Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or the `version` field.

| Branch | npm tag  | Channel           |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| `main` | `latest` | Stable            |
| `stg`  | `rc`     | Release candidate |
